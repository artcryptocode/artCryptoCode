Simple questions: 

Can the work of art be seen by a computer? 
Pixels in nft yes, and why not the code that allows to generate it?

If the computer had an eye would it see the same thing as the pixel seen by the human eye? 

A punk is chosen at random and we generate the code that allows to generate it in pure code

The cryptocode is the javascript code to display a punk, does this code have a value?
